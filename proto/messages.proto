 A scheduled event is an event that will be published at a specific time in the future.

 1. As a normal event that will be stored in the event stream
 2. As a deadline event that will not be stored in the event stream but will be used to trigger a deadline

 Deadline events are not handled by the event store and will not be present in the event stores various services
